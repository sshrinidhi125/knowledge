# Operating System

An **operating system (OS)** is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

## Single Task vs Multi Tasking OS
A single-tasking system can only run one program at a time, while a multi-tasking operating system allows more than one program to be running concurrently. 

## Single Vs Multi User 
Single-user operating systems have no facilities to distinguish users but may allow multiple programs to run

A multi-user operating system extends the basic concept of multi-tasking with facilities that identify processes and resources, such as disk space, belonging to multiple users, and the system permits multiple users to interact with the system at the same time

## Embedded
Embedded operating systems are designed to be used in embedded computer systems. They are designed to operate on small machines with less autonomy

## Mainframe
A mainframe computer, informally called a mainframe or big iron, is a computer used primarily by large organizations for critical applications like bulk data processing for tasks such as censuses, industry and consumer statistics, enterprise resource planning, and large-scale transaction processing. The most popular variants are OS/360, IBM Z/OS

## Microsoft OS
Microsoft Windows is a family of proprietary operating systems designed by Microsoft Corporation and primarily targeted to x86 architecture based computers.

## Unix OS
Unix is a family of multitasking, multi-user computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, whose development started in 1969 at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. The most popular varieties of UNIX are Sun Solaris, GNU/Linux, and MacOS X

## Linux OS
The Linux kernel originated in 1991, as a project of Linus Torvalds, a university student in Finland. Linux is Unix-like, but was developed without any Unix code. Because of its open license model, the Linux kernel code is available for study and modification. 

Linux is also commonly used on small energy-efficient computers, such as smartphones and smartwatches. The Linux kernel is used in some popular distributions, such as Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu and Google's Android, ChromeOS and ChromiumOS.

## MacOS
macOS (formerly "Mac OS X" and later "OS X") is a line of open core graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Apple Inc.,
